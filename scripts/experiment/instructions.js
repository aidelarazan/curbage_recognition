<p>WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO LEARN IN THIS RESEARCH?</p> <p> Memory decline is among the most commonly reported cognitive changes with aging. However, memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and involves different underlying processes and types of representations. Much of our understanding about memory and its effects on aging arise from paradigms that often involve learning a list of words or a set of images and later retrieving these items. Tests of this kind largely assess recognition memory processes for individual items--snapshots of perceptual experience in the context of a laboratory experiment. Although object-recognition paradigms offer important insights into basic memory processes and age-related changes, it is often limited to detecting perceptual changes among items or scenes. In contrast to perceptual information, another type of information present in memories is narrative structure. Events in our daily experiences tend not to be isolated, but are rather bound by contextual associations and meaning. An important and unresolved question is the extent to which memory for narrative details is affected by aging. Here, we are investigating whether there are age-related differences in recognition and recall of a narratively and perceptually rich stimuli that closely mimic the real world. </p><p><br></p>\
<p>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO SCIENTISTS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC? </p><p>This study is important to scientists or the general public because it is crucial to identify contributions to age-related cognitive decline. Testing memory for different aspects of naturalistic experiences may offer important insights into memory ability in healthy and pathological aging. </p><p><br></p>\
