## Project Description
Declining memory is a hallmark feature of cognitive aging. Memory, however, is not a unitary system, and instead involves different types of representations that may involve distinct pieces of information. Historically, much of our understanding of age-related memory decline arise from recognition of items that tend to focus on isolated perceptual details. Although there has been an increase in the use of naturalistic stimuli in recent years, these studies often involve unconstrained recall of narratives. This raises the question: when remembering lifelike experiences, do older adults show differential vulnerability in remembering perceptual versus narrative information? Here, we designed a task to tax mnemonic discrimination of information regarding narrative and perceptual domains. Repository includes: experiment code, data, and analyses notebooks.

### Experimental Design
Encoding: Participants watched an episode of a television sitcom (Curb Your Enthusiasm S01E07 AAMCO).

Retrieval: Participants completed two recognition tasks based on narrative or perceptual details, wherein the narrative recognition task consisted of identifying sentences as Old or New via button press and the perceptual recognition task consisted of identifying images as Old or New via button press. Each recognition task consisted of:
* 30 targets (described or depicted moments from the video encoded)
* 30 lures (moments described or depicted as being similar to the video encoded, but differing subtly from the video encoded, but looks or described similarly)
* 30 foils (described or depicted moments clearly not from the video encoded)
